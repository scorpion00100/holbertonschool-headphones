# Implement a design from scratch

In this project, you will implement a web page from scratch, without relying on any external libraries. You will leverage your knowledge of HTML, CSS, accessibility, and responsive design to create a fully functional web page.

## Objective

Your objective is straightforward: create a web page that mirrors the design provided by Nicolas Philippot, a UI/UX designer. You have the creative freedom to implement the page as you see fit, but it must match the designer's specifications.

## Designer's Specifications

The webpage design has been crafted by Nicolas Philippot. You can view the final screens [here](https://www.figma.com/file/FfnVADRC9xgI3yiZliTBYZ/Holberton-School---Headphone-company?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=T0VxNnhDO69IivfZ-0). Ensure that your implementation closely resembles these designs.

## Requirements

- **No External CSS Frameworks**: You are not allowed to import external CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap. All styling should be done using your own CSS.
  
- **No JavaScript**: JavaScript should not be used in this project. Focus solely on HTML and CSS to achieve the desired functionality and appearance.
